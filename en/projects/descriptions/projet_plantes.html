In this Master 2 research project, we studied the dynamics of interactions between vegetation and water resources in an arid ecosystem using a stochastic model.<br>
The objective was to better understand the mechanisms leading to the emergence of self-organized spatial structures, such as spotted or banded patterns observed in nature.<br>
These patterns can be used to quantify the pressures exerted on ecosystems and to prevent desertification.<br>
This probabilistic approach captures the influence of environmental fluctuations on the stability and organization of ecosystems under water stress.<br>
This project received the <strong>second highest grade</strong> in the master's program.
