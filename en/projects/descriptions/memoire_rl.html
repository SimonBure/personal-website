This M2 project explores the possible synergies between a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm within a simplified virtual environment.<br>
The objective is to mimic and model certain aspects of human cognition and decision-making by combining the abstraction and linguistic reasoning capabilities of the LLM with the adaptive learning inherent to RL.<br>
By integrating these two components, we sought to <strong>drastically improve the learning speed</strong> of RL by guiding it with reasoning provided by an LLM!<br>
This project received the <strong>highest grade</strong> among all students who participated in this course.
