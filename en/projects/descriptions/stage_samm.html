<p>This thesis develops a rigorous mathematical model of working memory based on discrete-time neural networks. Each neuron is characterized by its membrane potential and a short-term synaptic facilitation mechanism, modeled as a <strong>Markov chain</strong>.</p>

<p>The study establishes the conditions for <em>irreducibility</em> of the system and characterizes absorbing spaces to ensure persistent neural activity. Using a <strong>mean-field</strong> approach, we prove the convergence of the finite model to a limit process and compute the associated <em>stationary measure</em>.</p>

<p>The results reveal a precise sufficient condition for the emergence of <strong>non-trivial equilibria</strong> allowing information to be maintained in memory.</p>
