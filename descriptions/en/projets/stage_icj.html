This M2 research internship was conducted at the <strong>Institut Camille Jordan</strong>, under the supervision of Dr. Laurent Pujo-Menjouet.<br>
For six months, we studied the intracellular dynamics of several proteins of interest in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The project was highly <strong>original and innovative</strong>, as the proteins studied (ApoE and ATM) are not the ones commonly investigated in Alzheimer's research. The project also proposes a new theory to explain how the disease works, attempting to overcome the current limitations faced by research on the subject.<br>
The theory proposed here is that in individuals with genetic traits predisposing them to the disease (particularly certain versions of the ApoE gene), interactions between ApoE and ATM proteins clutter the cell nucleus throughout their lifetime. This clutter accumulates until it prevents the ATM protein from entering the nucleus to initiate DNA repair. ATM is indeed an extremely important protein for initiating DNA repair after damage, particularly radiative or chemical damage. Thus, damage accumulates on the double helix, eventually killing the cells—neurons in the case of Alzheimer's.
