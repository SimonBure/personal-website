The objective of this M1 research internship was to extend the genetic profile (GP) by incorporating biological age. The GP allows investigators, from DNA traces, to infer physical characteristics such as skin color, hair color, eye color, or biogeographic origin.
The GP is particularly useful when DNA traces recovered from crime scenes do not allow identification through the database.<br>
The internship consisted of adding biological age prediction to the GP, so it could then be used in the field.<br>
To finish on a high note, this internship was rewarded with the <strong>publication of an article</strong>, the <strong>first in France in the field of forensic science</strong>! You can find it on my website, in the Publications section.
