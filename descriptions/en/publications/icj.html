In this paper, we explored the possibility of <strong>predicting cancer proneness</strong> from the sensitivity of human cells to X-rays.<br>
My work focused on developing a mathematical model to quantify and model the cellular response to irradiation. This model was designed in close collaboration with biologists from INSERM in Lyon.<br>
The work presented here is <strong>highly original</strong>, as it focuses on the intracellular chemical dynamics of key proteins for DNA repair. The proposed theory is that these proteins would accumulate around the nucleus throughout the cell's life, gradually increasing the congestion around the nucleus until completely blocking DNA repair, which would play a crucial role in cancer.
